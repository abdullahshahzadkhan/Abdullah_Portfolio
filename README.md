# Abdullah_Shahzad_Portfolio # [Project 1: Spam-Ham Classification](https://github.com/abdullahshahzadkhan/Spam-Ham_Classification) * A machine learning model that separates spam messages from ham messages. The dataset consisted of email messages and their labels (0 for ham, 1 for spam). I have used the TF-IDF Vectorizer which gives weightage to important words and hence improves the accuracy of the model. ![](https://github.com/abdullahshahzadkhan/Abdullah_Shahzad_Portfolio/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(63).png)
