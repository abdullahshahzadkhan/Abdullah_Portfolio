## [Project 1: Spam-Ham Classification](https://github.com/abdullahshahzadkhan/Spam-Ham_Classification) 
* A machine learning model that separates spam messages from ham messages. The dataset consisted of email messages and their labels (0 for ham, 1 for spam). I have used the TF-IDF Vectorizer which gives weightage to important words and hence improves the accuracy of the model.

## [Project 2: Language Detection Model](https://github.com/abdullahshahzadkhan/Language_Detection_Model)
* This model is able to detect the given language. The dataset consisted of 17 different languages. Data was vectorized with TF-IDF vectorizer and then fitted into a Logistic Regression model for classification.
